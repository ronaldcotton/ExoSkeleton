# ExoSkeleton
ExoSkeleton is an adapted template from the original responsive boilerplate [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) to kickstart any web project.  Skeleton hasn't been updated in 6 years - this is a refresh the original Skeleton theme.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details of the original project.

## Getting started

To download the original unforked version of Skeleton:
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton.git` (hasn't been updated in over 6 years)

### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, and an index.html as a starting point.  Favicons are created from https://realfavicongenerator.net from 260x260+ square sources.  For Favicon Generator Options -> Path, choose /images/.

### Why it's awesome

The original Skeleton html template is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.

Exoskeleton aims to update and add features to skeleton.


## Browser support

Should work with most modern browsers after IE9.
