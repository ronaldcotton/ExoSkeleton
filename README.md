# ExoSkeleton
ExoSkeleton is an adapted template from the original responsive boilerplate [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) to kickstart any web project.  Because skeleton hasn't been updated in 6 years, this is my attempt at updating and upgrading features.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details of the original project.

## Getting started

To download the original unforked version of Skeleton:
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton.git` (hasn't been updated in over 6 years)

### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
Skeleton/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.css
│   └── skeleton.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why it's awesome

The original Skeleton html template is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.

Exoskeleton aims to update and add features to skeleton.


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
