# ExoSkeleton
ExoSkeleton is an adapted template from the original responsive boilerplate [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) to kickstart any web project.  Skeleton hasn't been updated in 6 years - this is a refresh the original Skeleton theme.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details of the original project.


## Browser Compatibility

See [IE Versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_version_history), [Firefox Versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_version_history), [Chrome Versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_version_history), [Safari Versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)), [Opera Versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Opera_web_browser), 

## Getting started

To download the original unforked version of Skeleton:
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton.git` (hasn't been updated in over 6 years)

### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, and an index.html as a starting point.  Favicons are created from [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) from 260x260+ square sources.  Either edit the images by hand, keeping the aspect ratio or use website to generate icons. For Favicon Generator Options -> Path, choose /images/.  For the rational of using multiple favicons, see [Real Favicon Generator FAQ](https://realfavicongenerator.net/faq).

### Why it's awesome

The original Skeleton html template is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.

Exoskeleton aims to update and add features to skeleton:
- Updated normalize.css
- Updated favicons
